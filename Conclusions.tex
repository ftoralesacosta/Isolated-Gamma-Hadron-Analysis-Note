\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}
We have reported a measurement of \gammaiso--hadron correlations in \pPb~and pp data at {5 TeV}. Our result significantly extends previous results by selecting isolated photons at lower momentum,  which is where the largest modifications of jet fragmentation in nuclear matter are expected. Our results indicate that there are no difference between the two datasets, within uncertainties. We also found that \textsc{Pythia8.2} describes the data within uncertainties. This constrains the effects of cold-nuclear matter effects. This result establishes a benchmark on photon identification for future measurements with higher statistics in \pPb~and \PbPb~collisions.
